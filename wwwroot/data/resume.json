  "Description": "Hello! I'm Vitor Novo, an enthusiast of Software Engineering at 20 years old, currently in the 3rd year of my Bachelor's Degree at the University of Trás-os-Montes and Alto Douro. My passion mainly lies in Back End development, where I can bring systems and applications to life through logic and programming. I have a keen interest and enthusiasm for game development, which has led me to create several games and experiences using the Unity platform (C#). My journey so far has been focused on honing my skills in various languages, with a focus on C, C++, and C#. Although I also have knowledge in Java, Python, and even some familiarity with JavaScript. I'm excited to continue expanding my knowledge and contributing to challenging and impactful projects.",
