  "Description": "Hello! I'm Vitor Novo, a 21-year-old enthusiast of Software Engineering who has successfully completed my Bachelor (Bologna 1st cycle degree) at the University of Trás-os-Montes and Alto Douro. My passion lies in Back End development, where I bring systems and applications to life through logic and programming. I am particularly enthusiastic about game development, and I've created several games and experiences using the Unity platform (C#). My journey so far has been focused on honing my skills in various languages, with a primary focus on C, C++, and C#. I also possess knowledge in Java, Python, and some familiarity with JavaScript. I am excited to continue expanding my knowledge and contributing to challenging and impactful projects.",
